# Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 

Welcome to my **Christmas Coding Challenge 2024** repository! This project is organized by the **[Women Coding Community](https://womencodingcommunity.com/)**. Through this challenge, I'm committing to solving one [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problem each day using Java or Python. The goal is to build consistent coding habits, improve my problem-solving skills, and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## ðŸ“… Challenge Goals

- Solve **one LeetCode problem daily** in Java or Python.
